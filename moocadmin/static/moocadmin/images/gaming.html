								<h2>Character: Awoken/Malakii
								<br />Played: 2005 - 2011 </h2>
								
								<p><a class='browser' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_warcraft'>World of Warcraft</a>, or WoW, was my first MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game). Famous for being 
							    one of the most successful games of this genre, playing it was an extremely enjoyable part of my life. Unfortunately, 
								the increasing popularity of the game lead to a huge decrease of the amount of skill and time required for players to excel
								in the game and many long time players, including myself, had quit shortly after the release of the games third expansion - World of Warcraft: Cataclysm</p>
								
								<p>I first played this game at an Internet Cafe in the Pavillion shopping mall in Durban - Unreal. It was installed on a few of the machines and people shared accounts to play. Someone had bought the game in the UK and brought it back. It was the first time I had played an MMO and the size, scope and mechanics of the game were simply mindblowing at the time - especially to someone whose online gaming experiences had been limited to Counterstrike. It was quite hard for me to get a copy of the game in South Africa. 
								The game was not sold locally at all. In the end, I managed to buy a copy through Amazon.co.uk, have it shipped to a friend of a friend in the UK, and have him mail it to me. 
								It was expensive and took over a month to arrive, but it was well worth it and an event that has shaped my life considerably. </p>
								
								<p> Being one of the first and only South African players on my realm of Emerald Dream, I played the game online with people mostly from the UK, Sweden, Finland, Denmark etc. I definitely learnt more about the world through WoW than any other part of my life at that time, and this knowledge was one of the main reasons I study overseas. 
								I didn't realise it at the time, but MMOs are unique in the fact that they attempt to simulate a virtual, living, persistant world. Playing and excelling in one of these is actually a passable training for real world experinces. To be able to be good at a game like WoW (at least during its early years), you had to be able to understand and master major concepts of the game world that draw major parralels to real life. Here are some examples of these concepts:
								
								<ul>
								<li>Economy </li>
								<li>Team Work </li>
								<li>Guild competition, player recruitment, organisational structure</li>
								<li>Persistance of game state/reputation</li>
								
								</ul> </p>
								
								<p> The first World of Warcraft game is known as 'vanilla' WoW. The first expansion, released at the start of 2007, is called <a class='browser' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_The_Burning_Crusade'> The Burning Crusade</a>(TBC). The third expansion is called
								<a class='browser' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Wrath_of_the_Lich_King'>Wrath of the Lich King</a> (WOTLK) and was released at the end of 2008. The third expansion was <a class='browser' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Cataclysm'>Cataclysm</a> (Cata) and was released at the end of 2010. </p>
								
								<p> For all of vanilla WoW (2005-2007), I played an elf rogue which I was not very good at. I have always played on the EU server Emerald Dream. Playing from South Africa was not usual and I had a delay of over 1000 milliseconds - ie everything I did in the game was delayed by 1 second, a huge disadvantage.
								At the start of TBC (around 2007), I switched to a human priest named Malakii. As a caster, I could use the ~1 second delay to my advantage with careful spell timing. 
								I played a priest for the remainder of the game. I've listed some notable achievements below. </p>
								
								
								<p><h2>Achievements</h2>
								<h1>Season 2 Gladiator</h1>
								I played in a ranked ladder tournament style aspect of the game known as 'Arena'. There were different 'brackets' - 3 players vs 3 other players, 5v5 or 2v2. Teams were 'premade' and this arena tournament
								was divided into different 'seasons' lasting ~6 months. Arena was a game mechanic introducted in The Burning Crusade. In Season 2 of TBC, I played in a 3v3 team with a rogue (Bbiz) and mage (Xidrr). Our
								team setup was hence Rogue, Mage, Priest (RMP). There are many different team combinations, counters etc. A rating system matches you with teams of similar rating, the more games you win, the higher your rating,
								Rating is based on the ELO chess system, starting at 1500 rating. We managed to get 2328 rating at the end of season 2, placing up in the top 0.5% of all players for which we were awarded the 'Gladiator' title.
								We were the only team on our server to achieve this in season 2, and we played and beat notable teams.
								
								<br /> <br />
								<h1>Guild Leader: Marine Parade Pirates</h1>
								I led the first South African guild on Horde side Emerald Dream - Marine Parade Pirates (MPP). Seeing as most of us are from Durban, our guild was named after the marine parade. 
								MPP was formed towards the end of WOTLK (mid 2010). I started the guild hoping it would be a 10 man raiding guild and we went on the clear all of the 10 man raiding content in WOTLK, including Lich King (the final boss in WOTLK).
								I led all raids (over ventrillo), managed guild forums and handled recruiting new players. Most of the players in the guild knew each other from living in Durban. We weren't a very serious guild, hence our slightly embarrasing guild banner below.

							 	<h1>Server First, EU Third 'For the Alliance!'</h1>
							  	In late 2008, the 'Achievement system' game mechanic was launched before the Wrath of the Lich King expansion. Some of these achievements were intended to be done after one had completed the expansion and gained 5 more levels. One of these achievements was 'For the Alliance!' which involved going to each of the opposing factions major cities and killing its main 'leader' (ie the leader of the orcs - Thrall). 
								This was meant to be done at level 80, while we were all still level 70. I arranged and led a 40 man raid that succeeded in being the first group on the server and the third on European realms that succeeded in killing these four bosses/leaders. It was extremely tough and tactical because the Horde on our server also jumped in tried to stop up while also attempting to assault our cities to complete 'For the Horde!" (they never succeeded).
